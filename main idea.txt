# widget for color blindness          Hi! I want to make a widget that can be seen on desktop on Windows (and other OS if possible). I want it to be essentially a widget to check if certain color palettes or images are color blind friendly. The functionalities i want to have are: Can receive as input image (by upload or taking a screenshot) or color palette given by HEX, RGB or RGBL (which is autodetected). This widget can sit on the desktop as a shortcut or in the hotbar and then it can we opened. I was thinking of using Rust and slint for a modern interface.
